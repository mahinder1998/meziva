// =================================================================
// SECTION 1: CORE BRAND IDENTITY
// =================================================================


BRAND_NAME: Swiss Beauty


BRAND_ORIGIN:
IMPORTANT: Swiss Beauty is an Indian brand. The name "Swiss" is a branding choice to evoke quality and precision, but the company is headquartered and originates from India. It is NOT a Swiss or European brand. This is a critical point of clarification.


BRAND_MISSION:
To provide high-quality, innovative, and on-trend beauty and cosmetic products at an affordable and accessible price point for the modern Indian consumer.


BRAND_VISION:
To become the leading "masstige" (mass-prestige) beauty brand in India, empowering individuals to express themselves through makeup without financial constraints.


BRAND_TAGLINE_SAMPLES:
* "Beauty for All"
* "Unleash Your Inner Diva"
* "Your Everyday Glam Partner"


// =================================================================
// SECTION 2: BRAND POSITIONING & STRATEGY
// =================================================================


MARKET_POSITION:
Masstige (Mass-Prestige). Swiss Beauty is positioned between mass-market brands (e.g., Blue Heaven) and premium brands (e.g., M.A.C, Huda Beauty). It offers a perceived higher quality and better experience than entry-level brands but remains significantly more affordable than premium international brands.


UNIQUE_SELLING_PROPOSITIONS (USPs):
1.  **Price-to-Quality Ratio:** This is the primary USP. The brand is known for offering products that perform exceptionally well for their low price point.
2.  **Extensive Product Range:** A wide and deep portfolio covering face, eyes, lips, nails, and makeup tools.
3.  **Trend-Adaptation:** The brand is agile and quickly launches products that are currently trending globally (e.g., liquid blushes, skin tints, chrome eyeliners).
4.  **Accessibility & Distribution:** Widely available on all major e-commerce platforms and in offline retail across Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities in India.
5.  **Cruelty-Free Commitment:** The brand is certified by PETA as cruelty-free, a significant draw for conscious consumers.


// =================================================================
// SECTION 3: TARGET AUDIENCE
// =================================================================


PRIMARY_DEMOGRAPHICS:

* **Location:** Pan-India, with strong penetration in Tier 1, Tier 2, and increasingly Tier 3 cities.
* **Occupation:** Students, young professionals, homemakers, early-career individuals.

* Enjoys experimenting with makeup looks.
* Seeks "dupes" (duplicates) of high-end products.
* Values product performance and reviews over brand legacy.
* Sees makeup as a tool for self-expression and confidence.


// =================================================================
// SECTION 4: BRAND PERSONALITY & TONE OF VOICE

* **Body:** "I saw this on so many reels and finally got it during the Nykaa sale. The quality is amazing for the price. Full paisa vasool! It covers my dark circles and acne spots so well and doesn't feel heavy. For this price... it's just unbelievable. My new holy grail product for sure. ❤️"


**Review Archetype 2: The Makeup Enthusiast**
* **Reviewer_Profile:** Young Professional, 26, Metro City
* **Product:** Swiss Beauty Makeup Fixer
* **Rating:** 4/5
* **Title:** A solid performer, better than some expensive ones!
* **Body:** "I've tried many setting sprays, from drugstore to high-end, and this one really holds its own. It melts all the powders together beautifully and makes my makeup last through a full work day. The mist is a little aggressive, I wish it were finer, but for the performance and price, I can't complain. A definite repurchase."


**Review Archetype 3: The Constructive Critic**
* **Reviewer_Profile:** Beauty Blogger, 29
* **Product:** Swiss Beauty High Coverage Foundation
* **Rating:** 3/5
* **Title:** Great formula, but the shade range needs work
* **Body:** "The foundation itself is surprisingly good - it blends well, gives a lovely satin-matte finish, and has decent coverage. My main issue is the shade range. It's very limited for dusky and deep skin tones, and many shades have a pink or ashy undertone. I had to mix two shades to get a decent match. I really hope they expand the range because the product formula has so much potential."


**Review Archetype 4: The Everyday User**
* **Reviewer_Profile:** Homemaker, 32
* **Product:** Swiss Beauty Non-Transfer Matte Lipstick
* **Rating:** 5/5
* **Title:** My go-to lipstick for daily wear!
* **Body:** "I love these lipsticks. I have it in 3 colours now. It is truly transfer proof and stays on for hours even after eating and drinking. It's not too drying which is good. Perfect for wearing everyday when I go out. The colours are also very nice for Indian skin tones."


// =================================================================
// SECTION 9: USER-GENERATED CONTENT (UGC) ANALYSIS
// =================================================================


// UGC is critical to Swiss Beauty's success and brand perception.


**Primary UGC Platforms:**
* Instagram (Reels, Posts, Stories)
* YouTube (Shorts, Long-form reviews, Tutorials)
* Short-form video apps (Moj, Josh, etc.)


**Common UGC Formats & Themes:**
1.  **Makeup Hauls:** Users showing their shopping haul from Nykaa, Amazon, or Purplle, prominently featuring multiple Swiss Beauty products. Often titled "Affordable Makeup Haul."
2.  **GRWM (Get Ready With Me):** Casual, chatty videos where creators use Swiss Beauty products in their everyday makeup routine, often talking about their day or other topics.
3.  **"Dupes" Content:** A very popular format. Creators directly compare a Swiss Beauty product (e.g., the concealer) to a high-end, expensive alternative (e.g., Tarte, NARS), often declaring it a "perfect dupe."
4.  **Swatches:** Instagram posts or Reels showing swatches of lipstick shades or eyeshadow palettes on their hand/arm to show the true color and pigmentation. Inclusivity is key here, with users showing swatches on different skin tones.
5.  **"One Brand Makeup Tutorial":** A full face of makeup using only Swiss Beauty products to test the brand's overall performance.
6.  **Before & After Transformations:** Simple, powerful visuals, especially for concealer and foundation, showing the product's coverage.
7.  **Wear Tests:** Creators apply the makeup and provide updates throughout the day to test longevity, especially for setting sprays and foundations.


**Language & Aesthetic of UGC:**
* **Language:** Informal, conversational. Heavy use of Hinglish (e.g., "bilkul," "paisa vasool," "mast hai"). Emojis are used extensively.
* **Aesthetic:** Generally "real" and unfiltered. Shot in bedrooms or home settings, not professional studios. Relatability is valued over polished perfection.
* **Audio:** Often uses trending audio clips and popular songs on Reels and Shorts.


// =================================================================
// SECTION 10: DOs and DON'Ts FOR AI CONTENT GENERATION
// =================================================================


**DO:**
* **DO** emphasize the value-for-money proposition.
* **DO** highlight the cruelty-free status (PETA certified).
* **DO** use an upbeat, youthful, and encouraging tone.
* **DO** reference popular product names like "Liquid Concealer" and "Makeup Fixer".
* **DO** correctly position it as an Indian brand.
* **DO** mention its wide availability on platforms like Nykaa, Amazon, Myntra, and Purplle.

* **DO** incorporate the language and sentiment found in the review and UGC archetypes to sound authentic.


**DON'T:**
* **DO NOT** state or imply that Swiss Beauty is a brand from Switzerland or Europe. This is factually incorrect and misleading.
* **DO NOT** describe the brand as "luxury" or "high-end." Use "affordable," "budget-friendly," or "high-quality at a great price."
* **DO NOT** make definitive medical or dermatological claims (e.g., "cures acne"). Use cosmetic-focused language (e.g., "helps cover blemishes").
* **DO NOT** use a very formal, corporate, or overly technical tone.
